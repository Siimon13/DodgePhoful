# Team HaoSim presents **Dodgephoful**
## Descripition
A dodgeball like augmented reality game using geolocation and accelerometer data from the user's phone. The user can either go on a website or open an app to setup the game then invite friends or everyone in the area with the app installed to play. The user's basic attack method is to swing his or her phone(with a phonestrap) as if throwing a real ball and an digital attack will be sent toawrd the direction he swung his phone in and with the force based on how fast he swung his phone. The user can also set traps using the phone app by setting the mode to trap mode and then tossing the traps out like one would throw a frisbee. The game ends when all players are eliminated, and the game can be played in team or free for all.
